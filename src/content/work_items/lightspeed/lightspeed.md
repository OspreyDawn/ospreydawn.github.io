When I joined Lightspeed, I was the 4th Product Designer to join the design team. I also knew nothing about the retail domain. The first thing I did, after being assigned to my first project and team, was to talk to customers.

I spent the next 3 years learning about the retail domain and building products by talking to small to medium business owners and their employees first. I learned about what was important to them in their own words and curated and shared this knowledge with my teams to make products that get their work done instead of getting in the way.

Products I worked on included reporting and analytics tools, user onboarding, payment processing, tools for administrators and checkout flows. 

For each project, I facilitated customer engagement planning and sessions, interviews, data collection and made internal documentation and communicated insights. I ran work-shops with my teams to highlight and balance technical hurdles with usability. Wherever I could, I looked for opportunities to champion the work of my colleagues to push our work forward like our in-house Design System or Data Pipeline infrastructure.

I built prototypes, from simple to complex, to further refine designs and gauge responses with business owners and employees alike. Finally, I helped coordinate with stakeholders across the company to ensure a smooth launch and defined and measured success metrics beyond just engagement and retention.

As a designer at Lightspeed, I learned a lot about process, how I work and what processes work best for those I collaborate with be it my colleagues or users. I look forward to taking these lessons to wherever I go next.
